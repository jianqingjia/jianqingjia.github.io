        As an educator, my journey began at Hebei Normal University, a place renowned for its commitment to nurturing teachers. This background laid the foundation for my philosophy in teaching mathematics, where I emphasize not only the mastery of theoretical concepts but also their practical application. At Syracuse University, my role as an instructor has allowed me to refine my teaching strategies and mentorship, impacting students' learning experiences positively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Central to my teaching philosophy is the belief that education should empower students to develop independent and critical thinking skills. Inspired by the Chinese proverb, "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime," I strive to create a learning environment that fosters curiosity, encourages active participation, and nurtures lifelong learning. My approach is student-centered, focusing on engagement, personalization, and practice to meet diverse learning needs and styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my comprehensive teaching philosophy document, I delve deeper into how these principles are applied in practice, illustrating my commitment to a supportive, inclusive, and equitable learning environment. From engagement strategies that ignite interest and foster understanding to personalized approaches that cater to individual learning styles, I detail the methods I employ to ensure that every student feels valued and empowered. Additionally, I discuss the importance of practice in solidifying understanding and building confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        I invite you to explore my <strong>full Teaching Philosophy</strong> <a href="/assets/pdf/TeachingStatement.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>, where I further elaborate on these concepts and share my experiences and strategies for effective teaching. This document reflects my dedication to not only imparting knowledge but also mentoring students to become confident, resilient, and independent thinkers equipped to navigate the challenges of our complex world.

          <p>
            My teaching journey in Syracuse University as an instructor of record starts from Spring 2021 during the tail end of the Covid pandemic. This unique time meant adapting to hybrid teaching, blending in-person and online instruction from pure online classes.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was thrilled to see the positive feedback from my teaching evaluations. Teaching my first course in a non-native language and achieving such positive student responses marked a significant personal victory. In response to the hybrid teaching model (both in-person and online),
             I provided all lecture recordings and notes, which, according to student feedback, were highly appreciated for their review value.
          </p>
          <p>
            I noticed a challenge: the lengthy one-hour and twenty-minute math lectures seemed to strain undergrad students' attention spans. 
            Mid-semester, I introduced short breaks featuring engaging videos or moments for meditation, which evaluations later confirmed as a beneficial change. I've proudly carried this practice into all future courses.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, I overlooked feedback regarding the WeBwork system's user-friendliness: students think the WeBwork system is not user-friendly.
            At the time, I didn't grasp the impact of this issue, a realization that would come to affect subsequent semesters. I thought that "deciding which homework system is beyond my control". You can see this ongoing story below, and it underscores the learning curve we all navigate as educators.

            After the experience of MAT 286, I was assigend to teach MAT 285, which appeared to be a easier task initially. 
            However, managing two sections with a total of 53 students presented a new set of challenges, especially with grading quizzes and exams, which became more time-consuming. The back-to-back lectures left me exhausted by the end of the day.

          </div>
          <p>
            The positive feedback continued with MAT 285, motivating me to maintain effective teaching strategies such as detailed examples and sharing lecture notes. To address reduced class attendance, I shifted from posting all
             lecture recordings to providing them upon request, encouraging actual lecture participation. This approach seemed to foster better class engagement, steering students away from overreliance on recordings and towards more active learning and attendance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Continuing from the previous story, I noted additional student concerns about the WeBWork system in MAT 285. This revealed an essential insight: unlike my previous MAT 286 students, who had a semester's experience with WeBWork, the MAT 285 cohort lacked
             this familiarity, leading to challenges in inputting mathematical formulas correctly. Recognizing this, I resolved to take proactive steps to assist future students with WeBWork, aiming to smooth their learning journey and minimize similar obstacles.

            I really enjoy the MAT 222 material; it's not only practical but also very relevant, both in academic research and everyday scenarios. The students in this course, selected through a placement test, usually have a solid background in math and statistics.
             This makes the class especially engaging and dynamic. I find each lecture enjoyable as students are self-motivated and participate actively, making the teaching experience particularly rewarding for me.

          <p>
            I felt confident in my lecture series for MAT 222, which was reflected in the mostly positive evaluations. The course demands a blend of teaching theoretical statistics and practical software application, making the standard lecture time seem short. 
            I invested considerable effort in preparing each lecture to ensure they were comprehensive and fluid. It's gratifying to see that students recognized and appreciated my thorough preparation, reflecting the hard work invested in the course. 
            Most of the efforts that we put into the course could be seen by the students.
          </p>
          <p>          
            Starting this semester, the teaching evaluation form added a question about my teaching effectiveness. Most students rated me well above average. 
            One student suggested I slow down when solving problems, leading me to focus on pacing in future lectures. My aim for the next semester is to find a better balance, ensuring all students can follow along comfortably.

            This semester, recognizing students' struggles with WeBWork, I began illustrating similar homework problems in class, specifically focusing on the correct insertion of mathematical formulas
             and the crucial role of parentheses. Additionally, I created homework hint documents, advising students to attempt problems on their own before consulting these aids.
              This approach appears effective, as evidenced by the absence of WeBWork complaints in this semester's evaluations. Reflecting on my growth, I now understand that while
               I can't change the system, I can change how I assist students, embracing the idea, "If you cannot change the world, change the way you see it."
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm truly heartened to see my teaching effectiveness rating improve. In one of the sections, an overwhelming majority, 22 out of 23 students, rated me as "Excellent." This feedback is incredibly motivating and affirming.

             I proactively reached out to them, inquiring about their comfort with the course material and their preferences for pacing.
              Additionally, if a student missed a lecture without explanation, I would follow up to ensure everything was alright, demonstrating my commitment to their success and well-being.

             Interestingly, one student's rating seemed inconsistent, likely a misselection, given their otherwise high ratings.
            It's truly heartwarming to witness the determination of students who, despite previous setbacks,
             choose to re-engage with the material under my guidance. One such student, previously receiving an 'F', opted to retake MAT 285 in Spring 2024, believing in their best performance in my class after multiple attempts.
